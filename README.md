# Annie Kim's Back End Web Development Final Project

This website was created with Ruby on Rails as a project for the General Assembly Spring 2015 Back End Web Development class. 

It required the use of at least two models, two controllers, use of **:resources** and **:form_for helpers**, and at least one association. 

The goal of the project was to create a functioning website that would collect stories and images from 18 fellows all around the United States to share internally and with donors of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF Global Citizenship Fellowship. 

The final product was created using Adobe InDesign and can be seen here: http://issuu.com/usfglobalcitizenship/docs/q4.
